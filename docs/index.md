# ðŸŒŠ BLINCAwave

**BLINCAwave** â€” *Boundary Layer Interacting with Capping Inversion and Atmospheric Waves* â€”  
is a modular solver for studying atmospheric boundary layer responses to internal gravity waves and turbineâ€‘scale forcings.

- **Waveâ€“mean flow coupling**
- **Turbulent closure testing**
- **Momentum and energy transfer diagnostics**

```bash
pip install -e .
