# Governing Equations

We solve horizontally inhomogeneous boundary‑layer equations with vertical diffusion and stratification effects:

$$
\partial_x \mathbf{q} = \mathcal{N}[\mathbf{q}; z] + \mathcal{F}(x,z),
$$

where $\mathbf{q}$ represents perturbation fields (e.g. $u', w', \eta$),  
$\mathcal{N}$ includes viscous/turbulent diffusion, and $\mathcal{F}$ represents body forcing such as gravity‑wave momentum input.
