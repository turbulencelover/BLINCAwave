# Theory Overview

BLINCAwave models the interaction between boundary-layer shear flows, capping inversions, and vertically propagating gravity-wave forcing.

The model decomposes the flow as:
$$
u(x,z,t) = \overline{U}(z) + u'(x,z,t),
$$
where the background profile $\overline{U}(z)$ satisfies prescribed boundary conditions and $u'$ evolves according to quasi-linear equations forced by external stresses.
